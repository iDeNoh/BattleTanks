# BattleTanks
Open world head to head tank fight game with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4

# General Concept
***
The game is a simple 1v1 large area battle, you will have to use a variety of ammo types and items to either destroy or disable an enemy tank.


The requirements will be:
	* A basic level
	* A few different types of tanks to start with
	* Assets for each type of ammo that you can pick up (either 2d or 3d)
	* Different sound effects for engine sounds, explosions, bullts, a rocky(bouldery?) sound, wind, and music.

The game is going to have to track:
	* Health for both tanks
	* Time of the current match
	* Points for this game
	* Ammo type
	* Ammo capacity
	* Useful items
	* Shields.
	
On top of all of that we are going to want to track individual stats between games, maybe have a user profile.
